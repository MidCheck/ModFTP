# ModFTP
Implementing FTP Protocol

##Why have this request?
My teacher left a programming task that mimics the functions of the FTP client and server. Before that, I wanted to implement various common network protocols to lay down my network foundation, so I had this requirement.

##What's this?
An FTP module developed using RFC959 can be used by other software.
